# Genetic-algorithms-with-docking
Project carried out as part of the Machine Learning in Drug Design course at the Jagiellonian University in Krakow under the mentorship of dr. Sabina Podlewska and mgr. Tomasz Danel. The group implementing the project: Kamil Harłacz, Artur Górak, Piotr Faron, Yurii Titov.

## Tasks 
The task of the project is to find a genetic algorithm generating chemical compounds with improved affinity (better results of
docking). The second goal is to compare different methods of compound mutation.

## Research hypotheses
- The applied genetic algorithm improves the function
docking assessments from population to population.
- The docking algorithm is optimized to
ensure a satisfactory docking speed at
high accuracy at the same time.
